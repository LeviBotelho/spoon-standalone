# Spoon Standalone Example

This example shows how to serve snapshots generated by Spoon Standalone from an ASP.NET MVC application using the Spoon Standalone Connector.

## Preparation

1. Create an Azure blob storage container.
2. Run the example site from Visual Studio. Take note of the address to the home page.
3. Grab a copy of Spoon Standalone and edit the configuration file found at /src/config.js. Add your Azure credentials and add the URL of the home page address to the `exports.urls` array. Leave `exports.sitemapUrl` blank.
4. Run Spoon Standalone to generate the snapshots for the sample site. Don't forget to execute `npm install` before running to install all required dependencies.
5. Using Fiddler or a similar tool, make a call to the following URL.
		[PATH TO THE EXAMPLE SITE]/?_escaped_fragment_=
	You should be served the snapshot generated by Spoon. The second paragraph on the page will contain the text "This is a dynamic paragraph".
